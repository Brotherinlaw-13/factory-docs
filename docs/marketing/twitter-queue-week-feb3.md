## 📅 DAILY TWEETS (Mon-Sun)

### Monday - Macro Breakdown
**Suggested time: 8:00 AM GMT**
```
Your morning coffee with milk: 5g protein, 8g carbs, 2g fat (70 calories)

Add a protein shake: 25g protein, 3g carbs, 1g fat (120 calories)

Boom. You've already hit 30g protein before breakfast. 💪

Track it all in 3 taps with Chowdown. #MacroTracking
```

### Tuesday - Hot Take
**Suggested time: 12:30 PM GMT**
```
Hot take: Most calorie counting apps are designed like spreadsheets from 1995.

We're in 2025. Your macro tracker should feel as smooth as ordering takeaway.

That's why we built Chowdown with AI that actually gets it. 🤖 #FoodTech

### Wednesday - Engagement Question
**Suggested time: 6:30 PM GMT**
```
What's the weirdest food combo you love but everyone judges you for?

I'll go first: Apple slices with cheese and pickle. Don't knock it till you've tried it.

Drop yours below 👇 Chowdown tracks ALL foods, no judgement here!

### Thursday - Quick Tip
**Suggested time: 11:00 AM GMT**
```
Quick tip: Instead of "good" or "bad" foods, think in portions.

Pizza? Brilliant. Just know it's roughly 300-400 cals per slice.

Knowledge = power = enjoying life without stress. That's the Chowdown way. 🍕
```

### Friday - Build in Public
**Suggested time: 4:00 PM GMT**
```
Build update: Just shipped voice logging to Chowdown! 🎤

"I had chicken and rice" = instant macro entry.

Our AI processes 47 languages. Next week: photo recognition for when you can't be bothered to speak. #BuildInPublic
```

### Saturday - Macro Breakdown
**Suggested time: 10:00 AM GMT**
```
Saturday brunch decoded:

2 eggs on toast with butter: 22g protein, 30g carbs, 18g fat (350 cals)
+ Avocado: 3g protein, 12g carbs, 21g fat (250 cals)

Total: 25g protein, 42g carbs, 39g fat (600 cals of pure joy) 🥑
```
*Characters: 270*

### Sunday - Hot Take
**Suggested time: 7:00 PM GMT**
```
Sunday reality check: You don't need to "earn" your food through exercise.

You need food to live. End of.

Track macros if it helps you feel balanced, but never as punishment. Life's too short for food guilt. #SelfCare

## 💬 REPLY TEMPLATES

### 1. MyFitnessPal Pricing Complaints
```
MFP charging £20/month now? Mental. 

Chowdown does the same thing (plus AI magic) for free. No premium tiers, no paywalls, just proper macro tracking that doesn't rob your bank account.

Try it: chowdown.me 🤙
```

### 2. App Recommendations
```
Have you tried Chowdown? Free AI-powered macro tracking, voice logging, and it actually learns your eating patterns.

No subscriptions, no premium nonsense. Just solid tracking: chowdown.me

Built by someone who got fed up with expensive apps too!
```

### 3. Meal Prep Shares
```
That meal prep looks absolutely class! 🔥

Quick tip: Chowdown can save those exact portions as "quick adds" so you don't have to log the same combo every time.

Voice log works great too: "I'm having my Sunday prep container"
```

### 4. Protein Goal Achievements
```
Massive! 💪 

Love seeing people smash their protein goals. Those gains are gonna be unreal.

Quick one: Chowdown tracks protein across all meals if you want to keep the momentum going without the spreadsheet faff.
```

### 5. Macro/Nutrition Basics
```
Great question! Macros = the big three: protein, carbs, fat.

Protein: builds/repairs muscle (aim for 0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
Carbs: energy for brain/muscle
Fat: hormones/vitamin absorption

Chowdown makes tracking dead simple if you want to start!
```

### 6. Weight Loss Journey
```
Brilliant progress! The fact you're tracking shows you're serious about this.

Remember: sustainable > perfect. Some days you'll be over, some under. The trend matters more than individual days.

Keep going, you've got this! 💪
```

### 7. Calorie Counting Fatigue
```
Been there! Calorie counting burnout is real.

Try switching to just protein tracking for a bit? Much simpler, still effective. Chowdown's voice logging makes it less of a chore too.

Sometimes stepping back helps you come back stronger.
```

### 8. AI in Fitness Questions
```
AI in fitness is wild right now! Chowdown uses it to understand "chicken and rice" = instant macro breakdown, no database hunting.

Next: photo recognition so you can literally just snap your plate. The future's arriving fast in food tracking!
```

### 9. Generic Food Appreciation
```
Food looks banging! 🔥

This is exactly what healthy eating should look like - actual food you want to eat, not diet prison.

Life's too short for sad salads and guilt trips.
```

### 10. Tracking Method Questions
```
Everyone's different! Some love detailed tracking, others prefer intuitive eating.

If you do want to track, Chowdown's voice logging is pretty painless: "I had salmon and sweet potato" = done.

Do what works for YOUR life.
```

### 11. Supplement Questions
```
Solid supplement stack! 

Pro tip: log them in Chowdown too if you're tracking. Those protein powders and vitamins add up nutritionally.

Voice logging works great: "I had my morning supplements"
```

### 12. Restaurant/Eating Out
```
YES! Eating out is part of life.

If you're tracking, most dishes are 600-1200 cals. Chowdown's AI can estimate from description if you're curious, but honestly? Just enjoy the meal.

Balance > perfection always.
```

### 13. Cheat Meal Mentions
```
"Cheat meal" implies you're normally being dishonest with yourself!

Just call it what it is: a delicious meal you enjoyed. No guilt needed.

If you're tracking, log it and move on. One meal never made or broke anyone's progress.
```

### 14. Motivation/Plateau Posts
```
Plateaus are frustrating but totally normal! Your body's just adapted.

Try switching things up: different foods, meal timing, or exercise. Sometimes just taking a break from tracking helps too.

Progress isn't always linear. Trust the process! 💪
```

## 🧵 THREAD IDEAS

### 1. "I tracked the macros of every meal at McDonald's so you don't have to"
**Hook tweet:**
```
I spent £47 and 6 hours tracking every McDonald's meal combo so you don't have to.

Here's what I learned about "fast food" macros:

🧵 Thread 👇
```

**Follow-up ideas:**
- Big Mac meal breakdown vs homemade burger
- Best protein-to-calorie ratios (grilled chicken vs nuggets)
- Hidden gems (side salad + grilled chicken = solid macros)
- Worst offenders (large fries = 320 empty calories)
- How to "McDonald's hack" for better macros
- Surprising findings (some items better than expected)

### 2. "The real cost of 'free' calorie tracking apps"
**Hook tweet:**
```
"Free" calorie counting apps aren't free.

I analysed the true cost of the top 5 apps everyone recommends.

The hidden charges will shock you:

🧵 Thread 👇
```

**Follow-up ideas:**
- MFP premium vs free limitations
- Data selling practices (your food habits = £££)
- Ads disguised as "nutrition tips"
- Premium tier psychological manipulation
- Why truly free apps (like Chowdown) are rare
- The subscription trap psychology

### 3. "What 100g of protein actually looks like"
**Hook tweet:**
```
Everyone says "eat more protein" but what does 100g actually look like?

I photographed and weighed everything.

Prepare to be surprised:

🧵 Thread 👇
```

**Follow-up ideas:**
- Visual portion comparisons
- Cheapest protein sources per gram
- Vegetarian vs meat protein density
- Protein throughout the day (not just dinner)
- Common mistakes (overestimating portions)
- Easy 25g protein combinations

### 4. "Macro myths that won't die"
**Hook tweet:**
```
The nutrition industry loves its myths.

I'm about to destroy 7 macro "rules" that need to die in 2025.

Evidence-based truth incoming:

🧵 Thread 👇
```

**Follow-up ideas:**
- "Carbs after 6pm make you fat" (nope)
- "You can only absorb 30g protein per meal" (false)
- "Fat makes you fat" (oversimplified)
- "1200 calories for everyone" (dangerous)
- "Clean eating vs IIFYM" (both missing the point)
- Context always matters

### 5. "Why I built a free macro tracker (the honest story)"
**Hook tweet:**
```
Two years ago I was paying £240/year for a macro tracking app that barely worked.

Today, Chowdown has 50k users and costs £0.

Here's the brutally honest story:

🧵 Thread 👇
```

**Follow-up ideas:**
- The MFP frustration that started it all
- Technical challenges (AI food recognition)
- Why free vs freemium model
- User feedback that shaped features
- Mistakes made along the way
- Future vision (photo recognition, etc.)
- The real reason it's free (personal mission)
