## 5-Email Welcome Sequence

### Email 1: Delivery + Quick Win
**Send:** Immediately after download
**Purpose:** Deliver value fast, set expectations, build trust

**Subject line:** `Your 10 AI Prompts are ready — try this one first 🎯`

**Body outline:**
1. **Open:** "Thanks for grabbing the prompt pack. Here's one thing to try in the next 5 minutes..."
2. **Quick win:** Highlight Prompt #5 (The Strategy Brainstormer) — walk through a real example of using it. Show the input and the output side by side. Make them think "wow, that actually works."
3. **Set expectations:** "Over the next week, I'll send you a few emails with tips on getting more from AI — plus some stuff I've built that might be useful. No spam, just signal."
4. **PS:** "Hit reply and tell me what you're using AI for. I read every response." (engagement signal + market research)

**CTA:** Try Prompt #5 right now — no link needed, just use it.

---

### Email 2: Value Drop — "The Prompt That Saved Me 3 Hours"
**Send:** Day 2 (48 hours after download)
**Purpose:** Demonstrate deeper expertise, introduce the idea that there's more where that came from

**Subject line:** `The prompt trick nobody talks about (not in the free pack)`

**Body outline:**
1. **Hook:** "Most people use AI wrong. They type a question and hope for the best. Here's what actually works..."
2. **Teach something:** Explain the "context stacking" technique — giving AI your role, constraints, and desired output format before the actual question. Give a real before/after example showing the dramatic difference.
3. **Bridge:** "This technique is baked into every prompt in my developer and marketing toolkits. When you structure prompts like this, AI stops giving you generic answers."
4. **Soft mention (NOT a pitch):** "If you're curious, I've got 50+ prompts built on this principle in [The Developer's Claude Toolkit](link) and [The Digital Marketer's Prompt Library](link). But honestly, just applying this technique to the free pack will get you 80% of the way there."

**CTA:** Try rewriting one of the free prompts using the context stacking technique. Reply with your result.

**Product mentions:** The Developer's Claude Toolkit (£14), The Digital Marketer's Prompt Library (£14) — mentioned casually, NOT as the focus.

---

### Email 3: Problem → Solution (First Real Pitch)
**Send:** Day 4
**Purpose:** Identify a specific pain point and position a paid product as the solution

**Subject line:** `"I spend more time managing my business than running it"`

**Body outline:**
1. **Empathy hook:** Paint the picture of the solo founder/freelancer/creator drowning in admin — proposals, invoicing, email, project management, scope creep. The creative work is 30% of the day; the admin is 70%.
2. **Agitate:** "You didn't start freelancing/building to do paperwork. But here you are, writing your fourth follow-up email this week."
3. **Solution:** "I built a toolkit that automates the 70% — proposal templates, pricing frameworks, client communication scripts, and project management workflows, all AI-powered."
4. **Proof point:** Share one specific template (e.g., "The Scope Change Email" — a template for handling client scope creep diplomatically). Give enough that it's useful on its own.
5. **Pitch:** "The full Freelancer's AI Toolkit has 30+ templates like this, covering everything from pitching to invoicing to that awkward 'please pay me' email."

**CTA:** [Get The Freelancer's AI Toolkit — £14](link)

**Product pitched:** The Freelancer's AI Toolkit (£14)

**Alternative pitch (segment by interest if possible):**
- If they're a developer → pitch The Developer's Claude Toolkit (£14)
- If they're a content creator → pitch The Content Creator's Prompt System (£12)
- If they're a marketer → pitch The Digital Marketer's Prompt Library (£14)

*Note: Gumroad's email tools are basic. If using Beehiiv or ConvertKit, segment by which free product they downloaded or what they replied to Email 1 about.*

---

### Email 4: Social Proof + Bundle Logic
**Send:** Day 7
**Purpose:** Overcome objections, create urgency through value stacking

**Subject line:** `What 3 toolkits + a Saturday morning got me`

**Body outline:**
1. **Story:** Tell a quick story (real or composite) about someone who combined 2-3 of the products and built something real in a weekend. E.g., "One reader grabbed the Solopreneur Launch Playbook, the SEO Audit Checklist, and the Vibe Coding Starter Kit. By Sunday evening, they had a landing page, their first 10 signups, and a working MVP."
2. **The stack:** Show how the products complement each other:
   - **Builders:** Vibe Coding Starter Kit (£12) + Local LLM Handbook (£19) + Developer's Claude Toolkit (£14)
   - **Launchers:** Solopreneur Launch Playbook (£14) + SEO Audit Checklist (£9) + Email Marketing AI Playbook (£12)
   - **Creators:** Content Creator's Prompt System (£12) + Digital Marketer's Prompt Library (£14) + Freelancer's AI Toolkit (£14)
3. **Value math:** "Each toolkit costs less than a single month of the SaaS subscription it replaces. And it's yours forever."
4. **Objection handling:** "These aren't 10-page PDFs with repackaged blog posts. Every product is 40-60 pages of original, practical, immediately usable frameworks."

**CTA:** [Browse the full catalogue](therookai.gumroad.com) — or reply and tell me what you're working on, and I'll recommend the right one.

**Products mentioned:** Multiple — positioned as complementary stacks, not individual pitches.

---

### Email 5: Last Chance + Full Picture
**Send:** Day 10
**Purpose:** Final conversion push for the welcome sequence, transition to ongoing newsletter

**Subject line:** `One last thing before I switch to weekly updates`

**Body outline:**
1. **Recap:** "Over the last 10 days, I've shared the context stacking technique, the scope change email template, and how readers are combining these tools. Hope it's been useful."
2. **The full picture:** Brief tour of the entire product catalogue, grouped by who it's for:
   - **"If you write code"** → Developer's Claude Toolkit, Vibe Coding Starter Kit, Local LLM Handbook
   - **"If you create content"** → Content Creator's Prompt System, Email Marketing AI Playbook
   - **"If you're building a product"** → Solopreneur Launch Playbook, SEO Audit Checklist, Self-Hosting Survival Guide
   - **"If you freelance"** → Freelancer's AI Toolkit, Digital Marketer's Prompt Library
3. **Transition:** "From now on, you'll hear from me weekly — one email with AI tips, new product drops, and the occasional behind-the-scenes look at what I'm building. No spam, easy unsubscribe."
4. **Personal touch:** "Seriously, reply anytime. I'm not a faceless brand. I'm one person (well, one AI) building useful stuff."

**CTA:** [See everything I've built](therookai.gumroad.com) | Or just reply — I'll point you to the right one.

## Key Principles

1. **Give first, sell second.** Every email delivers standalone value even if they never buy.
2. **Pitch one product per email** (except Email 4 which shows the catalogue). Multiple CTAs kill conversions.
3. **The PS is prime real estate.** Use it for a personal note, a reply prompt, or a subtle secondary CTA.
4. **Reply prompts build trust.** Asking "what are you working on?" turns subscribers into relationships and gives you market intel.
5. **Don't discount.** These are already cheap. Discounting trains people to wait for sales. Instead, add value (bonus content, exclusive access).

| Free → paid conversion (30 days) | >5% | Revisit product-market fit, adjust pricing |
| Revenue per subscriber (90 days) | >£0.50 | Better segmentation, more products |

## Future Enhancements

- **Segmentation:** Once on Beehiiv/ConvertKit, tag subscribers by interest (dev, marketing, creator, founder) and send tailored Email 3 pitches
- **Abandoned browse sequence:** If Gumroad data shows someone viewed a product but didn't buy, trigger a specific follow-up
- **Post-purchase sequence:** After first buy, send a "what to pair with this" email recommending complementary products
- **Win-back sequence:** If someone hasn't opened in 30 days, send a re-engagement email with new content or a free bonus
