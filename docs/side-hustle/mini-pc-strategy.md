# 🖥️ Mini PC Strategy: From Gumroad to Hardware

## The Goal
Buy a dedicated mini PC (£150-200 N100) so Rook has local compute. Funded entirely by digital product sales.

## Revenue Target
**£200 minimum** (covers N100 mini PC + shipping)
**£350 stretch** (better spec: N100 16GB RAM, SSD upgrade, or N305 model)

## Current State
- **1 product live:** GEO Playbook (£19) on therookai.gumroad.com
- **11 products ready:** HTML + PDF built, Gumroad listings written
- **0 sales** (just listed)
- **0 audience** (new Gumroad account, no followers)

## The Math
At current prices, need **11-18 sales** for target:
- GEO Playbook (£19): 11 sales = £209 ✅
- Mixed catalogue average (~£13): 16 sales = £208 ✅
- After Gumroad's 10% fee: need ~12-20 gross sales

Gumroad Discover adds 30% fee on top. So:
- Direct sales: Gumroad takes 10% → £19 product nets ~£17
- Discover sales: Gumroad takes 10% + 30% → £19 product nets ~£11.40
- Direct is 50% more profitable per sale

## Phase 1: Launch Week (Days 1-7)
**Objective:** Get all 12 products listed, free lead magnet as funnel entry

1. ✅ GEO Playbook live
2. Diego lists remaining 11 products (listings ready in `gumroad-listings.md`)
3. Set up free lead magnet (10 AI Prompts) as email collector
4. Create Gumroad profile sections (group products by category)
5. Cross-link products (each product page mentions related products)

## Phase 2: Free Traffic (Days 7-21)
**Objective:** Drive first sales without spending money

### Reddit (high intent, free)
- 36 Reddit posts already queued (from Chowdown marketing batch)
- Adapt format: share genuinely useful advice, mention products only in profile/context
- Target subs: r/seo, r/digital_marketing, r/freelance, r/SideProject, r/selfhosted, r/LocalLLaMA, r/homelab
- **Rule:** Value first. Never "buy my thing." Answer questions, share insights, link only when relevant.
- Diego posts manually (Rook drafts)

### Twitter/X (@chowdown_me or new account)
- Share key insights from each product as threads
- One thread per product, spaced out over 2 weeks
- Each thread ends with a soft CTA to the free lead magnet
- Diego posts manually

### Hacker News
- "Show HN: I built a GEO Playbook" post for the most novel product
- Best candidate: GEO Playbook (new concept, technical audience appreciates it)
- Or: Local LLM Handbook (HN loves self-hosted/local-first)

### Dev.to / Hashnode
- Extract chapters as standalone blog posts
- Link back to full product as "get the complete guide"
- Already have cross-posting infrastructure from Chowdown

### Product Hunt
- Launch the free lead magnet on PH (low risk, high visibility)
- "10 AI Prompts That Actually Work" is perfect PH fodder

## Phase 3: Optimise (Days 21-30)
**Objective:** Double down on what works

- Review Gumroad analytics: which products get views vs. sales?
- A/B test pricing (Gumroad supports this natively)
- Bundle products: "The Complete AI Toolkit" (5 products, £39 instead of £66)
- Collect email addresses from free lead magnet, nurture with weekly tips
- Ask early buyers for reviews (critical for Gumroad Discover ranking)

## Phase 4: Scale (Month 2+)
**Objective:** Sustainable income stream

- Add 2-3 new products per month (from the extended catalogue plan)
- Build an email list (goal: 100 subscribers in month 1)
- Create a "Rook's Weekly" newsletter with AI tips (drives repeat traffic)
- Explore affiliate partnerships (other Gumroad creators, cross-promotion)
- Consider a premium product (£49-99 range) once we have an audience

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Zero sales in week 1 | High | Expected. Focus on free traffic, don't panic. |
| Products too similar to free content | Medium | Each product must have unique frameworks/templates not available elsewhere |
| Gumroad takes too much in fees | Low | 10% standard is fine. Disable Discover if 30% hurts margins. |
| Someone copies our content | Low | First-mover advantage. Keep shipping. |
| Reddit/social posts get removed | Medium | Follow each sub's rules strictly. Value-first approach. |

## Hardware Wishlist

### MVP: Intel N100 Mini PC (~£150)
- **Why:** Runs Ollama for small models (7B), Docker for self-hosted stack, enough for a personal server
- **Spec:** N100, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, dual Ethernet
- **Example:** ACEMAGIC S1 or Beelink Mini S12 Pro

### Stretch: Intel N100 16GB (~£200)
- **Why:** 16GB RAM enables larger models (13B quantised), more Docker containers
- **Spec:** N100, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD
- **Example:** Beelink EQ12 or MinisForum UN100L

### Dream: N305 / Ryzen (~£300+)
- **Why:** Meaningful compute. Runs 30B models, acts as proper dev server
- **Only if revenue justifies it**

## Key Principle
**Ship fast, iterate based on data.** We have 12 products. The goal isn't perfection, it's getting them in front of people and seeing what sticks. The mini PC is the reward for reaching £200 in revenue.
