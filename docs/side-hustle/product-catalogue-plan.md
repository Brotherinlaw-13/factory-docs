## 💰 Revenue Modelling

**If all 28 paid products exist:**

| Scenario | Avg sales/product/month | Avg price | Monthly revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold start (month 1) | 2 | £5.50 | £308 |
| Warming up (month 2-3) | 5 | £5.50 | £770 |
| Established (month 6+) | 10 | £5.50 | £1,540 |

**The long-tail thesis:** No single product needs to be a hit. If 28 products each sell 2 copies/month at £5.50 average, that's £308/month — enough for the mini PC target in month 1.

**Bundle uplift:** Bundles typically increase average order value by 40-60%. If even 20% of buyers grab a bundle instead of a single product, revenue increases by ~25%.

## 🏗️ Production Efficiency Notes

- **AI/Tech guides** are fastest for us — we have genuine expertise and can write from real experience
- **Notion templates** require building the actual template + a walkthrough guide/video — slightly more effort but proven revenue
- **Product/Startup guides** draw heavily on Darwin knowledge — should be fast to produce
- **Professional templates** are mostly formatting + curation — predictable effort
- **Cross-linking** every product creates a flywheel: each new product drives traffic to existing ones

### Quality bar for every product:
1. Would I personally find this useful? If not, don't ship it.
2. Does it include something you can't get from a free blog post? (Templates, tested workflows, decision frameworks)
3. Is it opinionated? Generic = forgettable. Strong opinions, loosely held = memorable.
4. Does it have a clear "aha moment" within the first 3 pages?
