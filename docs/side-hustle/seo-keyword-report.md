## General Marketplace Insights

### Gumroad Discover Search Dynamics
- **Gumroad Discover is the primary internal discovery engine** — product titles, descriptions, and tags directly influence search ranking
- The marketplace is **heavily saturated** in generic AI/ChatGPT prompt categories (768+ results for "ChatGPT prompts bundle", 1143+ for "AI prompts marketing")
- **Niche-specific products outperform generic bundles** in conversion rate despite lower traffic
- Mega-bundles (100K+ prompts) dominate by volume but have low perceived quality — opportunity exists for curated, specific toolkits
- **Free/PWYW products** are the #1 lead generation strategy on Gumroad (Interactive Book of Prompting: 108K+ downloads, 2,332 ratings)
- Products with the word "Playbook", "Toolkit", "System", or "Blueprint" in titles consistently appear in top results across categories

### Key Gumroad SEO Factors
1. **Product title** — most important ranking signal on Discover
2. **Tags** — Gumroad allows tagging; top tags in our space: `ai`, `chatgpt`, `chatgpt prompts`, `marketing`, `seo`, `productivity`
3. **Description keywords** — indexed for search
4. **Sales velocity + ratings** — social proof boosts rankings
5. **Price positioning** — free/PWYW products get massively more visibility

### Category Placement
Most relevant Gumroad categories for our products:
- **Business & Money > Marketing & Sales** (for SEO, marketing, email products)
- **Business & Money > Entrepreneurship** (for solopreneur, launch products)
- **Software Development > Programming** (for developer, vibe coding products)
- **Self Improvement > Productivity** (for AI workflow products)

**Rationale:** Matches Tanguy's successful title format. Includes "ChatGPT" keyword for discoverability. Spells out the benefit.

#### Competition Level: 🟢 LOW
Only 21 results. Main competitor (Tanguy) has significant sales (287) but this is still an emerging niche. Our £19 price point undercuts his €25.

### 2. Developer's Claude Toolkit (£14) — AI Prompts for Developers

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion

**Suggested:** "Developer's Claude Toolkit: 50+ AI Prompts & Workflows for Software Engineers — Debug, Refactor & Ship Faster with Claude"  
**Rationale:** "Claude" is a growing search term on Gumroad. Adding "software engineers" captures a different query. Benefit-driven subtitle.

#### Competition Level: 🟡 MEDIUM
Claude-specific products are emerging but the "AI prompts for developers" space is crowded. Differentiation via Claude-specific positioning is strong — most competitors are ChatGPT-focused.

---

### 3. Freelancer's AI Toolkit (£14) — AI Workflows for Freelancers

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad
| # | Product | Creator | Price | Rating | Reviews |
|---|---------|---------|-------|--------|---------|

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Freelancer's AI Toolkit"  
**Suggested:** "Freelancer's AI Toolkit: Save 10+ Hours/Week with AI Workflows for Proposals, Client Management & Content Creation"  
**Rationale:** Differentiate from the $10 competitor (which is ChatGPT-only). Emphasise workflows over prompts. Time-saving hook.

#### Competition Level: 🟡 MEDIUM
Direct competitor exists at lower price ($10) but with only 2 reviews. Space is moderately competitive. Workflow-focused positioning differentiates from generic prompt bundles.

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "SEO Audit Checklist"  
**Suggested:** "The Complete SEO Audit Checklist 2026: 100+ Point Framework for Technical, On-Page & Off-Page SEO"  
**Rationale:** Adding year makes it feel current. "100+ Point" adds perceived value. Including "Technical, On-Page & Off-Page" captures multiple search queries.

#### Competition Level: 🟡 MEDIUM
102 results for "SEO checklist template" but many are bundled inside larger products. Standalone SEO audit checklists are relatively rare. At £9 it's the lowest price point — good impulse buy positioning.

### 5. 10 AI Prompts That Actually Work (FREE) — Lead Magnet

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad
| # | Product | Creator | Price | Rating | Reviews | Downloads |
|---|---------|---------|-------|--------|---------|-----------|

3. `best ChatGPT prompts 2026` (time-stamped, moderate competition)
4. `ChatGPT prompt templates free` (high volume, high competition)
5. `AI prompts for beginners` (segment-specific, moderate competition)

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "10 AI Prompts That Actually Work"  
**Suggested:** "10 AI Prompts That Actually Work: Free Starter Kit for ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini — Tested Prompts for Real Results"  
**Rationale:** Adding AI model names massively boosts discoverability. "Free Starter Kit" signals lead magnet. "Tested" differentiates from generic bundles.

#### Competition Level: 🔴 HIGH
The free/PWYW AI prompts space is incredibly crowded (768+ results). However, as a lead magnet the goal isn't to compete — it's to capture emails. The "Actually Work" framing is a strong differentiator vs the "100K+ prompt" spam products.

### 6. Digital Marketer's Prompt Library (£14) — Marketing AI Prompts

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad

**Suggested:** "The Digital Marketer's AI Prompt Library: 100+ Ready-to-Use Prompts for SEO, Social Media, Email & Ads — Works with ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini"  
**Rationale:** Quantifying prompts adds perceived value. Channel-specific keywords capture multiple queries. Multi-AI compatibility is a differentiator.

#### Competition Level: 🔴 HIGH
1,143 results is extremely competitive. The market is flooded with generic prompt bundles. Differentiation must come from specificity (marketing-only) and quality positioning.

### 7. Email Marketing AI Playbook (£12) — Email Automation Guide

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Email Marketing AI Playbook"  
**Suggested:** "Email Marketing AI Playbook: Write High-Converting Email Sequences, Subject Lines & Automations with ChatGPT & Claude"  
**Rationale:** "High-Converting" is a power keyword. Specific deliverables (sequences, subject lines) match search intent. AI model names boost discovery.

#### Competition Level: 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH
192 results for "email marketing playbook". Most competitors are broader business guides that include email as a chapter. A dedicated email + AI product has a positioning advantage.

---

### 8. Solopreneur Launch Playbook (£14) — Launch Framework

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad
| # | Product | Creator | Price | Rating | Reviews |
|---|---------|---------|-------|--------|---------|

4. `how to launch a side hustle` (high intent, moderate competition)
5. `product launch framework` (specific, low competition)

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Solopreneur Launch Playbook"  
**Suggested:** "The Solopreneur Launch Playbook: Step-by-Step Framework to Launch Your First Digital Product in 30 Days"  
**Rationale:** "30 Days" adds urgency and specificity. "First Digital Product" captures beginner intent. "Step-by-Step Framework" matches search behaviour.

#### Competition Level: 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM
Only 43 results for "solopreneur toolkit" and 106 for "solopreneur launch". The space is growing but not yet saturated. Anfernee (recurring competitor) has multiple products but low review counts.

### 9. Vibe Coding Starter Kit (£12) — AI Coding Guide

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad
| # | Product | Creator | Price | Rating | Reviews |
|---|---------|---------|-------|--------|---------|

2. `AI coding for beginners` (high intent, moderate competition)
3. `Cursor AI tutorial` (tool-specific, low competition)
4. `build apps with AI no code` (high volume, moderate competition)
5. `Claude code tutorial` (specific, growing)

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Vibe Coding Starter Kit"  
**Suggested:** "Vibe Coding Starter Kit: Build Real Apps with AI — A Beginner's Guide to Cursor, Claude & Copilot"  
**Rationale:** "Vibe Coding" is trending terminology (Andrej Karpathy coined it). Adding tool names captures specific queries. "Build Real Apps" is benefit-driven.

#### Competition Level: 🟢 LOW
"Vibe coding" is a brand-new term (2025/2026). Only 108 results and most aren't directly about vibe coding methodology. "Claude Code for Designers" (40 reviews) is the closest competitor but targets designers, not beginners. First-mover advantage is strong here.

### 10. Local LLM Handbook (£19) — Run AI Locally Guide

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad
| # | Product | Creator | Price | Rating | Reviews |
|---|---------|---------|-------|--------|---------|

4. `self-hosted AI setup` (intent-match, low competition)
5. `private AI local machine` (privacy-focused, very low competition)

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Local LLM Handbook"  
**Suggested:** "The Local LLM Handbook: Run AI on Your Own Machine with Ollama, LM Studio & Open-Source Models — Complete Privacy, Zero Cloud Costs"  
**Rationale:** Tool names (Ollama, LM Studio) are high-intent search terms. Privacy and cost angles are strong buyer motivators. Extremely underserved niche.

#### Competition Level: 🟢 VERY LOW ⭐
**This is our biggest opportunity.** Only 8 results for "run AI locally ollama" and 16 for "local LLM guide". No direct competitor exists on Gumroad for a comprehensive local LLM guide. Most results are apps/software, not educational content. At £19 this can command premium positioning.

---

### 11. Self-Hosting Survival Guide (£14) — Self-Hosting Setup Guide

#### Top 5 Competing Products on Gumroad

3. `self hosted apps guide` (specific, very low competition)
4. `Docker self hosting beginner` (tool-specific, very low on Gumroad)
5. `replace cloud services self host` (intent-match, very low)

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Self-Hosting Survival Guide"  
**Suggested:** "The Self-Hosting Survival Guide: Set Up Your Own Homelab with Docker, Nginx & Free Open-Source Apps — Ditch Cloud Subscriptions Forever"  
**Rationale:** "Homelab" is the community keyword. Docker/Nginx are searched tools. "Ditch Cloud Subscriptions" matches buyer motivation. Only 1 result for "homelab" on Gumroad!

#### Competition Level: 🟢 VERY LOW ⭐
**Another massive opportunity.** Only 1 direct result for "self hosting homelab"! The Raspberry Pi guide ($29) is the closest competitor but focuses on NAS/cloud storage, not general self-hosting. This is an underserved niche with a passionate community (r/selfhosted has 400K+ members).

#### Title Optimisation Suggestion
**Current:** "Content Creator's Prompt System"  
**Suggested:** "The Content Creator's AI Prompt System: Generate a Month of Social Media, Blog & Video Content in Under 2 Hours"  
**Rationale:** Time-saving hook is powerful. Multi-format (social, blog, video) captures broader queries. "Month of Content" is a compelling promise.

#### Competition Level: 🟡 MEDIUM
Moderate competition. The "content creator" space is broad but most products are Notion templates or Instagram-specific. A system-focused product that covers multiple platforms has a positioning edge.
