## Profile Sections

Organise products into logical groups on the Gumroad profile page. Gumroad allows custom sections with descriptions.

---

### Section 1: 🆓 Start Here (Free)

**Description:**
> Grab this first. 10 AI prompts we actually use — for content, code, and strategy. No email course, no upsell wall. Just useful prompts.

**Products:**

| Product | Price | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 10 AI Prompts That Actually Work | FREE | Lead magnet, entry point to the funnel |

**Why this section exists:** First thing visitors see. Removes friction. Captures email. Demonstrates quality before asking for money.

---

### Section 2: 🤖 AI & Prompt Toolkits

**Description:**
> Stop asking AI vague questions and getting vague answers. These toolkits give you copy-paste prompts, workflows, and systems for getting genuinely useful output from Claude, ChatGPT, and Copilot.

**Products:**

| Product | Price | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| The Developer's Claude Toolkit | £14 | Software engineers, full-stack developers |
| The Digital Marketer's Prompt Library | £14 | SEO, social, email, and paid ads marketers |
| The Content Creator's Prompt System | £12 | Bloggers, newsletter writers, YouTubers |
| The Freelancer's AI Toolkit | £14 | Freelancers and consultants of any discipline |

**Cross-sell note:** Each toolkit serves a different audience but uses the same "context stacking" prompt methodology. Buyers of one often grab another.

---

### Section 3: 🚀 Launch & Growth Playbooks

**Description:**
> From first idea to first customer. Playbooks for pricing, launching, marketing, and growing — written for solo founders and small teams who don't have a marketing department.

**Products:**

| Product | Price | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| The Solopreneur Launch Playbook | £14 | First-time founders, side project builders |
| The SEO Audit Checklist | £9 | Anyone with a website that needs traffic |
| The Email Marketing AI Playbook | £12 | Newsletter writers, product sellers, SaaS founders |
| The GEO Playbook | varies | Marketers preparing for AI-powered search |

**Cross-sell note:** These stack naturally — launch → SEO → email marketing is a common buyer journey.

---

### Section 4: 🛠️ Developer & Infrastructure Guides

**Description:**
> Run your own AI models. Host your own stack. Build apps with AI as your co-pilot. Technical guides for developers who want independence from cloud subscriptions.

**Products:**

| Product | Price | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| The Local LLM Handbook | £19 | Developers, privacy advocates, tinkerers |
| The Vibe Coding Starter Kit | £12 | Developers using AI coding assistants |
| The Self-Hosting Survival Guide | £14 | Self-hosters, homelab enthusiasts, privacy-conscious users |

**Cross-sell note:** The self-hosting → local LLM pipeline is strong. People who host their own services are the exact audience for running their own AI.

## Profile Design Notes

### Pinned / Featured Product
Pin **10 AI Prompts That Actually Work (FREE)** as the featured product. Every visitor should see the free offer first.

### Profile Image
Use the TheRookAI logo/brand mark. Keep it clean — a simple icon or wordmark. No stock photos of laptops.

If Gumroad supports a cover/banner: use a clean banner with the tagline "AI-powered toolkits for builders, creators, and founders" and a visual showing 2-3 product covers fanned out.

### Social Links
- Link to the newsletter signup (once Rook's Weekly is live)
- Link to Twitter/X if using @therookai or similar handle
- Link to a landing page if one exists (therookai.com or similar)

## Product Presentation Best Practices

1. **Every product gets 3-4 preview images:** Cover, table of contents, one content page, one template/framework page
2. **Price anchoring:** Mention what the alternative costs. "A freelance consultant charges £150/hr for this advice. This is £14, once."
3. **Specificity wins:** "50+ prompts" beats "a prompt library." "40-60 pages" beats "comprehensive guide."
4. **Social proof:** As reviews come in, feature them prominently. Even 2-3 ratings make a difference on Gumroad.
5. **Bundle opportunities:** Once 3+ products exist in a section, create a section bundle at 20-25% discount. E.g., "AI Prompt Toolkit Bundle" = Developer + Marketer + Creator for £30 (vs £40 individual).
