## Bundle Strategy

### Pricing Philosophy

- **Bundle discount: 30–40% off** individual pricing (industry standard for digital bundles)
- **Anchor to individual prices** — always show "worth £XX" alongside the bundle price
- **Each bundle tells a story** — a clear persona + outcome, not just random products grouped together
- **Overlap is OK** — a customer buying multiple bundles means they're a superfan; don't optimise against that

## 🎯 Bundle 1: The AI Marketing Suite

> *"Everything you need to market your business with AI."*

**Who it's for:** Digital marketers, small business owners, marketing freelancers  
**The pitch:** From SEO and GEO strategy to email sequences and content creation — the complete AI-powered marketing stack.

| Product | Individual Price |
|---------|-----------------|
| The GEO Playbook | £19 |
| The Digital Marketer's Prompt Library | £14 |
| The Email Marketing AI Playbook | £12 |
| The Content Creator's Prompt System | £12 |
| The SEO Audit Checklist | £9 |

**Individual total:** £66  
**Bundle price: £39** (41% saving)  
**Why it works:** This is the no-brainer bundle. These five products form a complete marketing workflow — discover (SEO/GEO) → create (content) → distribute (email) → measure (audit). The £39 price point is the sweet spot for a "marketing toolkit" purchase. It's also the bundle most likely to be an impulse buy at launch.

## 🔧 Bundle 2: The Developer's AI Toolkit

> *"Ship faster, debug smarter, build with AI as your co-pilot."*

**Who it's for:** Software developers, indie hackers, tech leads  
**The pitch:** 50+ Claude prompts, vibe coding workflows, and the complete guide to running LLMs on your own hardware.

| Product | Individual Price |
|---------|-----------------|
| The Developer's Claude Toolkit | £14 |
| The Vibe Coding Starter Kit | £12 |
| The Local LLM Handbook | £19 |

**Individual total:** £45  
**Bundle price: £29** (36% saving)  
**Why it works:** Developers are the highest-intent buyers in the AI space. This bundle gives them prompts (Claude Toolkit), workflows (Vibe Coding), and infrastructure independence (Local LLMs). The £29 price is less than a single month of most AI subscriptions — easy to justify. Keeping it at 3 products makes it feel focused rather than bloated.

## 🚀 Bundle 3: The Solopreneur Starter Pack

> *"From idea to income: everything a solo founder needs to launch, market, and grow."*

**Who it's for:** Solo founders, side hustlers, aspiring entrepreneurs  
**The pitch:** Launch your business, win your first clients, set up your infrastructure, and market like a pro — all AI-powered.

| Product | Individual Price |
|---------|-----------------|
| The Solopreneur Launch Playbook | £14 |
| The Freelancer's AI Toolkit | £14 |
| The Email Marketing AI Playbook | £12 |
| The Self-Hosting Survival Guide | £14 |

**Individual total:** £54  
**Bundle price: £34** (37% saving)  
**Why it works:** The solopreneur journey in a box — launch (playbook) → get clients (freelancer toolkit) → nurture them (email) → save money on tools (self-hosting). This bundle appeals to the Reddit/Indie Hackers crowd who want to bootstrap everything. The Self-Hosting guide is the differentiator — it adds a "scrappy founder" angle that no competing bundle offers.

## 💎 Bundle 4: The Complete Library (Mega Bundle)

> *"Every product we make. One price. Forever."*

**Who it's for:** Superfans, agencies, teams, "I want everything" buyers  
**The pitch:** All 11 paid products at one unbeatable price. Get every future update included.

| Product | Individual Price |
|---------|-----------------|
| All 11 paid products | £153 total |

**Individual total:** £153  
**Bundle price: £69** (55% saving)  
**Why it works:** Every catalogue needs a mega bundle. The £69 price point is psychologically powerful — it's under £70, it's the kind of number people remember, and the 55% saving makes it feel like stealing. This will be the highest revenue-per-transaction item. Position it as "best value" on the store page. Consider making it a limited launch offer at £49 for the first week, then raising to £69.

## Launch Tactics

### Pricing Anchoring
On every bundle page, show:
1. The individual prices crossed out
2. The "you save £XX" amount
3. A visual comparison (strikethrough vs bold bundle price)

### Bundle Upgrade Path
After someone buys an individual product, email them:
> *"You just bought [Product]. Did you know you can upgrade to the [relevant bundle] for just £XX more?"*
This requires tracking what they've bought and offering a prorated upgrade. Gumroad supports this natively.

### Free Lead Magnet → Bundle Funnel
1. Customer downloads "10 AI Prompts That Actually Work" (free)
2. Thank-you page shows: "Want more? Here's our best bundles..."
3. Email sequence over 5 days nurtures toward **AI Marketing Suite** (broadest appeal) or **Complete Library**

### Launch Week Special
- First 48 hours: Complete Library at **£49** instead of £69
- Creates urgency + rewards early adopters
- After 48h, raise to £59 for the first week, then £69 permanently

### Bundle-Only Bonuses (optional, future)
Consider adding exclusive extras to bundles to make them even more compelling:
- AI Marketing Suite → bonus "Social Media Calendar Template"
- Developer's AI Toolkit → bonus "Claude API Cheat Sheet"
- Solopreneur Starter Pack → bonus "First 30 Days Checklist"
- Complete Library → all bonuses + early access to new products

## Revenue Projections (Rough)

Assuming first-month sales mix:

| Item | Units | Price | Revenue |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| Free Lead Magnet | 500 | £0 | £0 |
| Individual products (avg) | 50 | £13 | £650 |
| AI Marketing Suite | 30 | £39 | £1,170 |
| Developer's AI Toolkit | 20 | £29 | £580 |
| Solopreneur Starter Pack | 15 | £34 | £510 |
| Complete Library | 25 | £69 | £1,725 |
| **Total** | | | **£4,635** |

These are conservative estimates. The free lead magnet drives the funnel — if 500 download it and 18% convert to any paid product, that's 90 paying customers at an average of ~£40 = ~£3,600 from the funnel alone.
