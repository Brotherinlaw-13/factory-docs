# How AI Search Engines Choose What to Cite (And How to Make Them Pick You)

When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best CRM for small agencies?", the AI doesn't return a list of links. It names specific brands. If yours isn't mentioned, you don't exist in that moment.

This is the new reality of search. Over 65% of Google searches now end without a click. ChatGPT has 300M+ monthly active users. Perplexity processes 500M+ queries a month. And Google AI Overviews appear across billions of searches.

The brands that understand how these engines select their sources will dominate the next decade. Here's exactly how it works.

## The RAG Pipeline: How AI Builds Its Answers

Most modern AI search engines use a process called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Understanding this pipeline is essential because each step represents an opportunity to optimise.

### Step 1: Query Decomposition

The user's prompt gets broken into sub-queries. A question like *"What's the best CRM for small businesses in the UK?"* might become three separate searches: "top CRM software," "CRM for small businesses," and "UK CRM tools."

**Your lever:** Ensure your content addresses specific sub-topics, not just broad themes.

### Step 2: Source Retrieval

The engine searches its index (or the live web) for relevant sources. This step resembles traditional search: domain authority, relevance, and freshness all matter.

**Your lever:** SEO fundamentals still apply. Ranking, domain authority, indexing, and crawlability are your entry ticket.

### Step 3: Relevance Scoring

Retrieved sources are scored for topical relevance, authority, recency, and specificity. Typically, the engine retrieves 20-50 candidate sources and narrows to the top 5-10.

**Your lever:** Content specificity, recency, statistical density, and structural clarity all influence scoring.

### Step 4: Synthesis and Generation

The language model reads the top-scoring sources and generates a response, weaving in information from multiple pages. This is where the AI decides *what* to say and *who* to credit.

**Your lever:** Write quotable passages, clear definitions, and easily extractable facts.

### Step 5: Citation Assignment

Some engines (Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) attach source citations to specific claims. Others (ChatGPT, Claude) may mention sources conversationally.

**Your lever:** Keep your brand name close to key claims. Use clear authorship and schema markup.

## The 7 Signals AI Engines Use to Select Sources

Based on the landmark GEO research paper (Princeton, Georgia Tech, Allen Institute, IIT Delhi) and extensive industry testing, these are the primary signals:

### 1. Topical Authority (★★★★★)

How deeply and broadly you cover a specific topic across your domain. An AI engine cross-references multiple pages from your site. One blog post won't cut it.

**Action:** Build content clusters with 10-20 articles per core topic. Interlink them aggressively.

### 2. Citation Density (★★★★★)

How often your brand is mentioned across *external* sources. This is the "consensus effect": if 18 sources mention Klaviyo and only 2 mention your platform, the AI names Klaviyo.

**Action:** Earn brand mentions on 20+ external sites per key topic. Reviews, forums, publications, guest posts.

### 3. Content Structure (★★★★☆)

Clear headings, direct answers, lists, and tables that LLMs can parse. AI engines need to extract information cleanly.

**Action:** Use semantic HTML, comparison tables, and bulleted lists. Lead with direct answers, not lengthy intros.

### 4. Statistical Evidence (★★★★☆)

Data points, percentages, and research-backed claims. AI engines love citing concrete numbers.

**Action:** Include 3-5 statistics per page, all with named sources.

### 5. Recency (★★★★☆)

How recently your content was published or updated. Stale content gets deprioritised, especially on Perplexity.

**Action:** Update key pages quarterly. Show visible "Last updated" dates.

### 6. E-E-A-T Signals (★★★★☆)

Demonstrated Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. Author bios, expert quotes, credentials, and real case studies.

**Action:** Add author bios with credentials. Include expert quotes. Show real case studies with measurable results.

### 7. Quotability (★★★☆☆)

Concise, well-phrased statements that can be extracted as standalone claims. Think "tweetable" opening sentences.

**Action:** Write a clear, authoritative first sentence for every section. Make it something an AI would confidently quote.

## The Consensus Effect: Why Your Own Website Isn't Enough

Here's the insight most marketers miss: **your own website carries less weight than external mentions.**

AI engines categorise sources into trust tiers:

| Trust Tier | Source Type | Examples | Weight |
|-----------|------------|---------|--------|
| **Tier 1** | Institutional | .gov, .edu, Wikipedia, PubMed | Highest |
| **Tier 2** | Editorial | Forbes, TechCrunch, BBC | High |
| **Tier 3** | Expert | Gartner, HBR, professional bodies | High |
| **Tier 4** | Community | Reddit, Stack Overflow, G2 reviews | Medium-High |
| **Tier 5** | Brand | Your own website | Medium |
| **Tier 6** | General | Generic blogs, article farms | Low |

Your website is Tier 5. External mentions from Tiers 1-4 carry more weight. An external mention strategy is at least as important as on-site optimisation.

## Quick Wins: What to Do This Week

1. **Audit your robots.txt.** Make sure AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot) can access your content.
2. **Add statistics.** Go through your top 5 pages and add 3-5 data points each with named sources.
3. **Structure for extraction.** Add comparison tables, FAQ sections, and clear definition sentences.
4. **Check your AI visibility.** Search for your brand on Perplexity and ChatGPT. If neither mentions you, you have work to do.
5. **Start building external mentions.** Contribute to relevant forums, earn reviews, pitch guest posts.

## The Four Engines Are Not Equal

Each AI search engine has different retrieval behaviours:

- **ChatGPT** relies on Bing + training data. Reddit presence influences training-data recommendations.
- **Claude** favours nuanced, technically deep content. Intellectual honesty performs better than absolute claims.
- **Perplexity** crawls the live web in real-time. Freshness is critical; content updated within 30 days has a measurable advantage.
- **Google AI Overviews** pulls almost exclusively from pages already in the top 10 organic results. SEO is your entry ticket.

Optimising for all four requires different tactics for each.
