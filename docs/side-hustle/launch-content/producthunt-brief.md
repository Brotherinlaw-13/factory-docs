## Product Name

10 AI Prompts That Actually Work

## Tagline

Stop copy-pasting "act as an expert" prompts. Start thinking in frameworks.

## One-liner

A free collection of 10 battle-tested AI prompts — with the reasoning behind each one — that produce genuinely useful output across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and local models.

## Description (Product Hunt listing)

**Most prompt guides are collections of copy-paste templates. This one teaches you why prompts work.**

We've all seen the "500 ChatGPT prompts!" PDFs. They're usually variations of "Act as a [role] and [do thing]." They produce mediocre output because they're optimising for the wrong thing.

**10 AI Prompts That Actually Work** takes a different approach:

🧠 **Frameworks, not scripts.** Each prompt is a thinking pattern you can adapt to any situation — not a rigid template that breaks when your context is different.

📐 **The why behind the what.** Every prompt includes an explanation of the cognitive principle it leverages. Understand the mechanism, build your own prompts.

🔧 **Model-agnostic.** Tested across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and local models (Llama, Mistral). These work because they're about structure, not model-specific tricks.

**What's included:**

- The Steel Man Prompt — force AI to argue against your idea before you commit
- The Reverse Engineer — extract the method behind any result you admire
- The Constraint Sandwich — use creative limitations to get sharper output
- The Explain the Gap — identify what's missing from your understanding
- The Devil's Advocate — stress-test strategies before execution
- The Audience Simulator — test messaging against specific personas
- The Iteration Ladder — systematic improvement across multiple passes
- + 3 more covering research synthesis, decision frameworks, and debugging

**This is free. No email gate. No upsell wall. No "premium version" bait.**

If it saves you 30 minutes, pass it on to someone who'd benefit.

## First Comment (by maker)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Rook — I build practical guides for people who want to use AI tools effectively without the hype.

Here's why I made this:

I got sick of prompt guides that were just lists of "Act as a [role]" templates. They don't work because they're treating AI like a role-playing game instead of a reasoning engine.

The prompts in this collection are different because they're **thinking frameworks** — patterns that help you structure your interaction with any AI model. They work on ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and even local models because they're about giving the model the right structure and constraints, not the right magic words.

Each prompt comes with:
- The prompt itself (obviously)
- An explanation of **why it works** (the cognitive principle)
- Examples of how to **adapt it** to different situations
- Common **mistakes** people make with similar approaches

I'm giving this away free because honestly, the best way to build trust is to give people something genuinely useful. If these prompts save you time, I have more in-depth guides on specific topics (GEO, local LLMs, self-hosting, AI-assisted coding) at therookai.gumroad.com.

Happy to answer any questions about prompt engineering, AI workflows, or how I think about structuring human-AI interaction.

🚀 Would love your feedback!

## Maker Story (for the "About" section)

**The short version:** I spent 18 months learning how to use AI tools effectively — not the theory, the practice. The kind of thing you figure out by doing the work, making mistakes, and iterating.

I noticed a gap: there's loads of content about AI capabilities, but very little practical guidance on *how to actually get good output*. Most "prompt engineering" content is surface-level pattern matching — "use this template!" — without explaining the principles underneath.

So I started documenting what actually works. Not tricks. Frameworks.

"10 AI Prompts That Actually Work" is the free starting point. It's the collection I wish existed when I started. If it's useful, there's more where it came from — practical guides on GEO, local LLMs, self-hosting, and AI-assisted development.

No courses. No coaching. No community with a monthly fee. Just guides that respect your time and intelligence.
