# Root Juice Launch Plan
*Research and Strategy for Diego's Plant Care App*

---

## Executive Summary

Root Juice is a smart plant care app that combines AI plant identification with environment-specific watering schedules. The app stands out by considering specific environmental factors (room humidity, radiator proximity, window direction, heating season) and features a distinctive old British botanist personality for all notifications and copy.

**Current State**: App is built and needs ~1 week of polish
**Market Opportunity**: Plant care apps are a proven $10M+ market with room for European-focused differentiation
**Recommended Strategy**: Freemium launch with App Store + PWA distribution, targeting UK/European plant parents with environmental awareness
