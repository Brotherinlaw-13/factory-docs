"But where do you get your protein?"

Every vegan has heard it a thousand times. And honestly, it's a fair question. Protein is crucial for muscle building, fat loss, and general health. Getting enough on a plant-based diet requires more thought than reaching for a chicken breast.

But it's completely achievable. You don't need obscure supplements, expensive superfoods, or a degree in nutrition. You just need to know which foods to prioritise, how to combine them, and how to track your intake.

Here's your complete guide to high protein plant-based eating.

## The Plant Protein Reality Check

Let's be upfront about the challenges before solving them.

**Plant proteins are generally less protein-dense per calorie than animal proteins.** Chicken breast gives you 31g of protein per 100g at 165 calories. Lentils give you 9g per 100g (cooked) at 116 calories. You need to eat a lot more volume of plant foods to match the protein content of animal sources.

**Most plant proteins are "incomplete."** They lack sufficient amounts of one or more essential amino acids. Grains are low in lysine. Legumes are low in methionine. This sounds scary but it's easily solved (more on that below).

**Protein absorption (bioavailability) is lower.** Your body absorbs roughly 90 to 95% of animal protein but only 70 to 85% of most plant proteins. This means you may need to aim slightly higher than the standard [1.6 to 2.2g/kg recommendation](/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-per-day); closer to 1.8 to 2.4g/kg.

Now the good news: none of these are dealbreakers. They just require awareness and planning.

## The Complete Protein Myth

You've probably heard you need to combine specific proteins at every meal ("rice and beans together!") to get a "complete" protein. This is outdated advice based on a 1971 book that was later corrected by its own author.

**The current scientific consensus:** as long as you eat a variety of protein sources across the day, your body pools amino acids and uses them as needed. You do NOT need to combine proteins at every single meal.

That said, eating complementary proteins at the same meal is often practical and delicious. Rice and beans is a classic combination for a reason. It's just not a biological requirement.

## Top Vegan Protein Sources (Ranked by Protein Per 100 Calories)

| Food | Protein per 100 cal | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| Seitan | 21g | Wheat gluten. Highest protein density of any plant food. |
| Tofu (firm) | 11g | Complete protein. Versatile. |
| Tempeh | 10g | Fermented soy. Better absorption than tofu. |
| Edamame | 9g | Great [high protein snack](/blog/best-high-protein-snacks-for-weight-loss). |
| Lentils (cooked) | 8g | High fibre too. |
| Nutritional yeast | 8g | B12-fortified versions are essential for vegans. |
| Black beans (cooked) | 7g | Excellent in Mexican-style dishes. |
| Chickpeas (cooked) | 6g | Roast them for a crunchy snack. |
| Peanut butter | 4g | Great for calories but not protein-efficient. |

**The takeaway:** Tofu, tempeh, seitan, and legumes should be your daily staples. Nuts and seeds are healthy but inefficient as primary protein sources.

## 8 Vegan High Protein Meals (Full Macros)

### 1. Tofu Scramble with Vegetables

## Practical Tips for Hitting Protein on a Vegan Diet

### 1. Front-Load Protein at Breakfast

Most vegan breakfasts are carb-heavy: toast, cereal, fruit, porridge with maple syrup. Starting with a high-protein breakfast (tofu scramble, protein oats, or a smoothie with protein powder) makes hitting your daily target much easier.

### 2. Add Protein Boosters

Sprinkle these on meals throughout the day:
- Nutritional yeast: 8g protein per 2 tablespoons
- Hemp seeds: 10g protein per 3 tablespoons
- Pumpkin seeds: 7g protein per 2 tablespoons

Small additions across 3 meals easily add 20 to 30g of protein without changing your meals.

### 3. Don't Rely on Nuts Alone

Almonds, cashews, and walnuts are healthy but they're fat sources first, protein sources second. 100 calories of almonds gives you just 3.5g of protein. The same calories from tofu gives you 11g. Use nuts for healthy fats, not as your protein strategy.

### 4. Consider a Plant Protein Supplement

If you're aiming for 2.0g/kg+ and finding it difficult through food alone, a pea protein or soy protein isolate is a simple solution. One scoop adds 20 to 25g of complete protein for about 120 calories. It's not cheating; it's practical.

### 5. Track Your Intake

Most vegans who think they're eating "plenty of protein" are actually falling short. The only way to know is to track. [Chowdown](https://app.chowdown.me) scans plant-based meals from photos just as easily as animal-based ones. Snap a photo of your tofu stir-fry or lentil curry and the AI breaks down the macros instantly.

Chowdown is [completely free](/blog/how-to-track-macros-for-free-2026), with no premium tier, making it accessible for everyone regardless of diet.

## Common Vegan Macro Mistakes

**Counting incomplete protein at face value.** If a food's protein is low in lysine (like wheat), your body can't use all of it for muscle building. Eat a variety of sources daily.

**Underestimating calories from plant fats.** Avocado, coconut, nuts, and oils add up fast. A handful of cashews is 280 calories. Track fats, not just protein.

**Ignoring B12.** Supplement B12; there's no reliable plant source. Eat iron-rich foods (lentils, spinach, fortified cereals) with vitamin C to aid absorption.

**Thinking you need to eat "clean."** [Flexible dieting works for vegans too](/blog/iifym-guide-flexible-dieting-beginners). A vegan protein bar or beyond burger can fit your macros perfectly.

## The Bottom Line

Hitting your protein targets on a vegan diet is absolutely achievable. It takes more planning than an omnivore diet, but the health and ethical benefits make it worthwhile for many people.

The formula:
1. Build every meal around a protein source (tofu, tempeh, seitan, legumes)
2. Use protein boosters (nutritional yeast, seeds, protein powder)
3. Aim for 1.8 to 2.4g protein per kg of body weight
4. Track your intake, especially when starting out
