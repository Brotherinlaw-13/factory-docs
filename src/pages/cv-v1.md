## Profile

AI Builder with 8+ years shipping SaaS products across marketplaces and B2B platforms. I go from idea to deployed product using TypeScript, SQL, and AI-assisted development — testing assumptions with working software, not slide decks. I've doubled conversion rates, launched revenue-critical features, and built products serving hundreds of thousands of users.

I build with Cursor, Claude, and Copilot daily. Not because it's trendy, but because it lets me ship in days what used to take sprints.
