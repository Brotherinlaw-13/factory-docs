## Profile

Builder who ships. 8+ years going from idea to deployed product across SaaS, marketplaces, and B2B platforms. I write TypeScript and SQL daily, build with AI-assisted tooling (Cursor, Claude, Copilot), and deploy to production — not decks.

I built my own AI agent (Rook) that handles research, automation, and now job hunting. If you're reading this email, it found you.
