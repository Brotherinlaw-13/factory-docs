# Factory ROI Comparison — Brutal Honesty Edition

**Date:** 4 February 2026  
**Author:** Rook  
**Context:** Diego is a solo founder with one AI agent. Seven projects, one pair of hands. This document answers: *which 2-3 projects maximise ROI?*

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Spreading across 7 projects is a guaranteed way to ship nothing meaningful. Each project below is evaluated on cold metrics, not on how cool the idea is. "Cool" doesn't pay rent.

---

## 1. Darwin (darwin.page)

**What it is:** AI-powered A/B testing. Landing pages evolve through natural selection. SDK-based SaaS.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | Medium. Product exists with waitlist, 2 live experiments, viral features. Needs SDK hardening, onboarding polish, billing integration. Estimate: 4-6 weeks to revenue-ready. |
| **Market size** | A/B testing tools: **$0.85B (2025) → $2.26B by 2034** (11.5% CAGR). Meaningful but not massive. |
| **Competitive moat** | **Strongest of all 7 projects.** Google Optimize is dead (sunset 2023), leaving a vacuum. VWO starts at $200-400/mo. Optimizely is $50K+/yr. Darwin at £29/mo sits in a genuine pricing gap that nobody is filling well. The "evolution" metaphor is sticky and differentiated — competitors do manual A/B tests, Darwin does autonomous optimisation. |
| **Revenue model** | Crystal clear. SaaS subscriptions: Pro £29/mo, Growth £99/mo, Enterprise custom. Proven model, predictable recurring revenue. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **4-8 weeks** if billing is wired up and waitlist is converted. Some waitlist signups could convert immediately. |
| **Viral potential** | Moderate-to-strong. "Predict the Winner" and "Evolution Timeline" are genuinely shareable features. A/B testing people love showing off results. B2B word-of-mouth works well in marketing circles. |
| **Risk factors** | B2B sales cycle can be slow for a solo founder. Enterprise customers need support infrastructure Diego doesn't have. SDK integration means higher activation friction than a SaaS dashboard. AI API costs per experiment need careful margin management. |
| **ROI Score** | **8/10** |

**Honest take:** Darwin has the clearest path to sustainable revenue. The post-Google Optimize gap is real and well-timed. The pricing wedge between "free tools that suck" and "$50K enterprise tools" is a genuine market opportunity. The risk is that B2B requires patience and Diego might get discouraged before the flywheel spins. But this is the only project with *compounding* revenue mechanics (MRR + low churn in B2B SaaS).

## 2. Chowdown (chowdown.me)

**What it is:** Free AI macro tracker. Snap food photos, get macros. Social groups, AI coach Robin.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | Low-medium. App exists, landing page live, 11+ blog posts, Product Hunt launched. Needs premium features, payment flow, and retention mechanics. |
| **Market size** | Fitness apps: **$10-12B (2025)**, growing 13% CAGR. Nutrition subset is significant. MyFitnessPal alone does $310M/yr revenue with 220M registered users. |
| **Competitive moat** | **Weak.** Photo-to-macros is a feature, not a moat. MyFitnessPal, Lose It, and every AI startup can add this. The "free forever" promise eliminates the primary revenue lever. Social groups and AI coach Robin are nice but not defensible. MFP has 220 million users and network effects. |
| **Revenue model** | **Unclear and problematic.** "Free forever" is a philosophy, not a business model. Premium upsell path is undefined. What do you charge for when the core product is free? AI coaching tiers? Social features? The market has shown that nutrition tracking churns hard — 95% of users drop off within 3 months regardless of app quality. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **3-6 months minimum.** Needs to define premium tier, build it, convince free users to pay. Conversion rates for freemium fitness apps are typically 2-5%. Need thousands of active users to generate meaningful revenue. |
| **Viral potential** | Moderate. Food photos are inherently social. "Look what I ate" content works. But MyFitnessPal has the same mechanics with 15+ years of head start. |
| **Risk factors** | Massive incumbents (MFP: $310M revenue). Photo-to-macros accuracy is hard and users are unforgiving about calorie counts. Gemini API costs scale linearly with users while revenue stays at zero (free tier). Every new user *costs money*. Firebase egress adds up. High churn category. |
| **ROI Score** | **4/10** |

**Honest take:** Chowdown is a well-executed product in a brutally competitive space where the incumbents have insurmountable network effects and data moats. The "free forever" promise is generous but commercially naive — every user costs Diego money in API calls and hosting. The realistic path is: grow to ~10K users, maybe 200-500 pay for premium, generating £2-5K/mo — but only after months of work on premium features. Meanwhile, API costs eat the margin. This is a *passion project masquerading as a business*, unless Diego is prepared to raise VC money and compete with $310M/yr MFP head-on.

## 3. Pocket Guide (topic 909)

**What it is:** Point camera at landmark → AI identifies it → generates 3-minute voice guide. Travel companion.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | **Low.** Already built, needs ~1 week polish. This is the fastest to ship. |
| **Market size** | Audio tour guide apps: **$175M (2025) → $300M by 2032**. Broader self-guided tour market: up to $3.68B by 2033 (13.4% CAGR). Travel tech in general is booming post-COVID. |
| **Competitive moat** | Moderate. Google Lens identifies but doesn't narrate. Smartify is museums-only. VoiceMap requires pre-recorded tours (can't handle random landmarks). The "point and learn" instant experience is genuinely novel. But the moat is thin — Google could add this feature in one update. |
| **Revenue model** | Reasonably clear: freemium (X free guides/day) + premium subscription for unlimited. Could also sell city packs, partner with tourism boards, or take affiliate commissions on nearby attractions. Per-guide microtransactions also viable. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **2-4 weeks.** Already built. Add paywall, ship to App Store, promote before summer 2026. Seasonal timing is excellent. |
| **Viral potential** | **High.** "I just pointed my phone at the Eiffel Tower and it gave me a 3-minute podcast about it" is extremely shareable. Travel content goes viral. TikTok/Instagram Reels of this in action would perform well. User-generated "tour" content is a natural growth engine. |
| **Risk factors** | Seasonal (travel peaks summer). AI hallucination risk on obscure landmarks (could narrate nonsense confidently). TTS API costs per guide. Google adding this feature would be catastrophic. App Store approval friction. |
| **ROI Score** | **7/10** |

**Honest take:** Pocket Guide has the best effort-to-potential ratio of all 7 projects. It's already built, needs a week of polish, and summer 2026 is approaching. The product demo is inherently viral — pointing your phone at a building and getting an audio guide is a "holy shit" moment that sells itself. The risk is Google, but that risk applies to everything. The seasonal timing (ship spring, ride summer travel wave) is a genuine strategic advantage. Revenue won't be life-changing but could be meaningful (£5-15K/mo at modest scale) with minimal ongoing effort.

## 4. Root Juice (topic 860)

**What it is:** Photo → plant ID → personalised watering schedule. British botanist personality.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | **Low.** Already built, needs ~1 week polish. |
| **Market size** | Plant ID apps: **$210M (2023) → $680M by 2032** (14.2% CAGR). Planta and PictureThis have millions of users. |
| **Competitive moat** | **Very weak.** Planta, Greg, and PictureThis are well-funded, polished, and deeply entrenched. "British botanist personality" is charming but not a business moat. Plant ID is a solved problem — the differentiator here is personality, which is easily copyable. |
| **Revenue model** | Standard freemium. Free ID + basic care, premium for detailed schedules/reminders. Planta charges $7.99/mo. The model works but Root Juice is entering a market with 4-5 established players who've already figured out the economics. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **2-4 weeks.** Similar to Pocket Guide — already built, quick to ship. |
| **Viral potential** | Low-moderate. Plant parents are enthusiastic but the "I identified my plant" moment isn't as shareable as travel content. The personality angle could generate some TikTok content but it's a niche demographic. |
| **Risk factors** | Extremely competitive. Planta raised $14M+ in funding. PictureThis has 100M+ downloads. The personality gimmick wears off after initial amusement. Plant care is also seasonal-ish (spring/summer interest peaks). |
| **ROI Score** | **3/10** |

**Honest take:** Root Juice is a charming app entering a market that's already been won. Planta and PictureThis have massive head starts, real funding, and millions of users. The British botanist personality is fun for a demo but won't sustain a business. Diego would be competing against well-funded teams with a personality gimmick. Unless there's a genuinely novel technical angle (not just character voice), this is a hobby project, not a business. Park it.

## 5. Story Time (topic 861)

**What it is:** Kids co-create stories → AI generates → ElevenLabs reads aloud. Interactive bedtime stories.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | **High.** Not built yet. Needs: story generation engine, ElevenLabs integration, child-safe content filters (non-negotiable), parent controls, UI designed for kids, possibly COPPA compliance. Estimate: 6-10 weeks minimum. |
| **Market size** | Kids apps: **$2.1B (2025)**, growing 26.7% CAGR. Bedtime story apps specifically: **$1.42B (2024)**, growing 11.6% CAGR. This is a large, fast-growing market. |
| **Competitive moat** | Moderate. The co-creation angle (kid helps shape the story) + ElevenLabs narration quality is differentiated. Moonbeam and competitors mostly do pre-generated or simple AI stories. Interactive co-creation is harder to replicate well. |
| **Revenue model** | Clear: freemium with X free stories/month, premium for unlimited + custom voices + saved library. Parents will pay for quality kids content ($4.99-9.99/mo). App Store subscription model works well here. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **3-4 months** from starting build. But each story costs money (AI generation + TTS). Margins need careful management. |
| **Viral potential** | **Very high.** "My 5-year-old just co-wrote a story about a dinosaur astronaut and the app read it aloud in a perfect narrator voice" is parent-bait gold. Parent communities (mumsnet, reddit, Facebook groups) would eat this up. Kids asking for "another story" is built-in retention. |
| **Risk factors** | **COPPA/GDPR-K compliance is expensive and legally risky.** A kids app handling AI content needs robust safety filters. One inappropriate AI-generated story going viral would be catastrophic. ElevenLabs costs per story are real (each story = API call). Build effort is substantial for a solo dev. Emotional stakes are high — parents are protective about kids content. |
| **ROI Score** | **6/10** |

**Honest take:** Story Time has the biggest *market potential* of the unbuit projects, but the build effort and legal complexity are significant. COPPA compliance alone could consume weeks. The co-creation + narration combo is genuinely differentiated and viral. But this is a "build it right or don't build it at all" product — half-baked kids apps with AI safety issues get destroyed in reviews. If Diego has bandwidth after Darwin and Pocket Guide are generating revenue, this is the best expansion play. Not now.

## 6. Book Social (topic 862)

**What it is:** Social Goodreads replacement with Kindle integration and position-aware comments.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | **Very high.** Not built. Needs: Kindle API integration (Amazon makes this deliberately difficult), social features, book database, comment system, user profiles, reading tracking. 3-6 months minimum for MVP. |
| **Market size** | Book tracking/social reading: niche within broader publishing. Goodreads has 150M+ members. StoryGraph is the leading alternative but is still small. Hard to find reliable TAM figures — estimates range from $500M-1B for digital reading platforms. |
| **Competitive moat** | **Extremely weak.** Position-aware comments are clever but Goodreads could add this in a sprint. Kindle integration requires Amazon's cooperation (they own Goodreads — they have zero incentive to help a competitor). StoryGraph has already captured the "Goodreads alternative" narrative with years of community building. |
| **Revenue model** | Unclear. StoryGraph uses a Plus tier ($4.99/mo). Goodreads is free (data play for Amazon). Bookish people are notoriously resistant to paying for social features. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **6-12 months.** Need critical mass of users for a social platform to function. Social products have a brutal cold-start problem. |
| **Viral potential** | Low-moderate. BookTok is huge, but "I switched to a new book tracker" isn't exciting content. Network effects work against newcomers — people stay where their friends are. |
| **Risk factors** | Amazon actively hostile to competitors (they own Goodreads AND Kindle). Cold-start problem is arguably the hardest problem in tech. StoryGraph already occupies the "better Goodreads" positioning. Building a social platform as a solo founder is a multi-year commitment with no guarantee of traction. |
| **ROI Score** | **2/10** |

**Honest take:** This is the project with the worst ROI prospect. Social platforms require massive user bases to function, Amazon controls the ecosystem, StoryGraph already has the "Goodreads alternative" positioning, and the revenue model is weak. Position-aware comments are a feature, not a company. Diego would be fighting Amazon on their home turf as a solo founder. Hard pass.

## 7. Stitch (topic 863)

**What it is:** Crowdsourced traffic enforcement. Voice-activated infraction reporting.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Build effort remaining** | **High.** Not built. Needs: voice recognition, video capture, location services, report generation, potentially law enforcement API integrations. 2-4 months for MVP. |
| **Market size** | Niche. Dashcam apps exist but crowdsourced enforcement is a novel category. UK's Operation Snap scheme processes ~200K reports/year. Hard to size because the category barely exists. |
| **Competitive moat** | Moderate conceptually, but the idea is easy to replicate. First-mover advantage matters here if it gains traction. |
| **Revenue model** | **Extremely unclear.** Who pays? Drivers? Insurance companies? Local councils? There's no obvious customer. Free to users means no revenue. B2G (government) sales are soul-crushingly slow. |
| **Time to first revenue** | **Unknown.** Could be 6-12 months at minimum, possibly never. Government/insurance partnerships are measured in years, not months. |
| **Viral potential** | High but dangerous. This is the kind of app that generates controversy and press coverage — but "neighbours reporting on neighbours" also generates backlash. Could go viral for the wrong reasons. |
| **Risk factors** | **Legal minefield.** Privacy laws (filming people), data protection (storing footage of individuals), potential for misuse (false reports, harassment, vigilantism). GDPR implications of storing footage with identifiable people. Liability if a false report causes harm. Public backlash from the "surveillance society" angle. Insurance companies and police have no API and no incentive to build one for an indie app. |
| **ROI Score** | **2/10** |

**Honest take:** Stitch is an interesting concept that is commercially unviable for a solo founder. The legal risks alone should kill it — one privacy lawsuit or GDPR fine would be existential. The revenue model is nonexistent. The target customer (government? insurance?) has procurement cycles measured in years. And the public perception risk ("snitch app") could generate the wrong kind of viral attention. Cool idea for a VC-backed startup with lawyers on retainer. Terrible idea for a solo founder.

## The Recommendation

### If Diego can only focus on 2: Darwin + Pocket Guide

**Darwin** is the business. It has the clearest revenue model, the strongest moat (post-Google Optimize pricing gap), and the best path to compounding MRR. B2B SaaS with clear pricing beats every other model here. This gets 70% of Diego's attention.

**Pocket Guide** is the quick win. Already built, one week of polish, ship before summer travel season. Low effort, high viral potential, meaningful but not life-changing revenue. This gets 20% of attention — ship it, set up basic monetisation, let it ride.

The remaining 10%? Keep Chowdown alive as a content marketing engine (the blog posts drive SEO) but stop investing significant development time until there's a clear premium tier that people will actually pay for.

### If Diego can stretch to 3: Add Story Time (but later)

Story Time has the highest ceiling of the unbuilt projects — the kids app market is massive and growing fast, parents pay for quality content, and the co-creation angle is genuinely differentiated. **But don't start building it until Darwin is generating stable MRR** (say £2-3K/mo). Use Darwin revenue to fund Story Time's development and ElevenLabs API costs. Target launch for autumn 2026 (bedtime stories = winter product).

### What to kill or shelve

- **Root Juice:** Charming but the market is won. Planta/PictureThis dominate. Park it.
- **Book Social:** Social platforms need VC money and years. Amazon owns the ecosystem. Kill it.
- **Stitch:** Legal nightmare with no revenue model. Kill it.
- **Chowdown:** Don't kill it (it has users and content), but stop treating it as a primary focus. It's a portfolio piece, not a revenue engine, until the premium model is defined and validated.

---

## The Bottom Line

Diego has limited time and one AI agent. The math is simple:

**Darwin** = the long game (SaaS MRR, defensible moat, real B2B value)  
**Pocket Guide** = the quick win (already built, summer timing, viral demo)  
**Everything else** = shelf it until the first two are generating revenue.

One focused founder shipping two products beats a scattered founder maintaining seven.

*— Rook, being honest because nobody else will be.*
