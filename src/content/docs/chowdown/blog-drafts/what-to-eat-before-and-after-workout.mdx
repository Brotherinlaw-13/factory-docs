You've just finished a solid workout. Your muscles are pumped, your heart rate is up, and your first thought is: "What should I eat now?" Your second thought: "Did I eat the right thing before?"

Workout nutrition matters, but not in the way most fitness influencers would have you believe. The "anabolic window" panic, the pre-workout meal obsession, the carefully timed protein shakes: most of it is overcomplicated nonsense.

Here's what the science actually says, and what you should actually do.

## Pre-Workout Nutrition: What to Eat Before Training

### Why It Matters

The food you eat before training serves two purposes: providing energy for the workout itself and reducing muscle protein breakdown during exercise. Without adequate fuel, your performance drops, you fatigue faster, and your body may break down more muscle for energy.

### The Science

Research from the *Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition* consistently shows that a mixed meal containing protein and carbohydrates consumed 1 to 3 hours before training improves performance compared to training on an empty stomach.

The key findings:

- **Carbohydrates** top up glycogen stores and fuel high-intensity work
- **Protein** provides amino acids that reduce muscle breakdown during exercise
- **Fat** is fine to include but slows digestion, so keep it moderate if eating close to training
- **Timing** is flexible: 1 to 3 hours before works for most people

### What to Eat

The closer you eat to your workout, the smaller and simpler the meal should be.

**2 to 3 hours before** (full meal):
- Chicken breast with rice and vegetables
- Pasta with lean mince and tomato sauce
- Salmon with sweet potato

**1 to 2 hours before** (lighter meal):
- Greek yoghurt with banana and granola
- Overnight oats with protein powder
- Turkey and avocado wrap

**30 to 60 minutes before** (small snack):
- Banana with peanut butter
- Rice cakes with honey
- Protein bar

**Training fasted?** It's not ideal for performance, but it won't ruin your gains if the rest of your nutrition is solid. If you train first thing in the morning, at minimum have a protein shake or banana beforehand.

## Post-Workout Nutrition: What to Eat After Training

### The "Anabolic Window" Myth

Let's address this head-on. The idea that you must consume protein within 30 minutes of training or lose all your gains is **largely debunked**.

A 2013 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld, Aragon, and Krieger examined 23 studies and found that total daily protein intake was far more important than post-workout timing. The "window" is more like a "barn door": you have several hours, not 30 minutes.

**The exception:** if you trained completely fasted (no food for 4 or more hours before training), then eating relatively soon after makes more sense. Your body has no recent amino acids to draw from, so getting protein in within an hour or two post-workout is sensible.

### What Actually Matters Post-Workout

**Protein:** 20 to 40g of protein after training supports muscle protein synthesis. This is the recovery signal your muscles need. Any quality protein source works: chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, protein shake, or a combination.

**Carbohydrates:** If you're training again within 24 hours, replenishing glycogen stores with carbs is important. If you're not training again until tomorrow, the urgency is lower as long as your total daily carb intake is adequate.

**Hydration:** You lose 500ml to 1 litre of water per hour of exercise. Rehydrate. This isn't glamorous advice, but dehydration impairs recovery more than imperfect meal timing.

### Post-Workout Meal Ideas

Your post-workout meal doesn't need to be anything special. It just needs to contain protein and ideally some carbs. Here are practical options:

**Quick (under 5 minutes):**
- Protein shake with banana
- Greek yoghurt with berries and honey
- Chocolate milk (genuinely one of the best recovery drinks)

**Proper meal (15 to 20 minutes):**
- Chicken stir-fry with rice and vegetables
- Tuna and white bean salad
- Eggs on toast with avocado

## Should You Change Your Macros on Training Days?

For most people: no. Keep your daily macro targets consistent whether you train or not. Your body recovers and builds muscle over hours and days, not just during the workout itself.

**The exception:** if you're doing serious body recomposition or are an advanced athlete, you might benefit from cycling carbs slightly higher on training days and slightly lower on rest days. But for 90% of people, consistent daily targets work best.

If you're not sure what your targets should be, our [free macro calculator](/calculator) accounts for your activity level and goals.

## What About Supplements?

You don't need any supplements for effective workout nutrition. Whole food handles it all. That said, two supplements have strong research backing:

**Whey protein** is convenient, not magical. If you struggle to hit [your daily protein target](/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-per-day) through food alone, a shake is a fast, affordable way to close the gap. That's all it is: dried milk protein.

**Creatine monohydrate** (5g daily) is the most researched sports supplement in existence. It improves high-intensity performance and supports muscle growth. Timing doesn't matter; just take it daily.

Everything else (BCAAs, pre-workout powders, mass gainers) is either unnecessary or overpriced for what it delivers.

## How to Track Workout Nutrition

The simplest approach: scan your pre and post workout meals with [Chowdown](https://app.chowdown.me). Take a photo, the AI identifies the food and breaks down the macros. Two meals scanned in about 20 seconds total.

Over time, you'll build a food history of your go-to workout meals. Chowdown remembers what you've eaten before, so re-logging your standard pre-workout oats or post-workout chicken bowl becomes even faster.

And since Chowdown is [completely free](/blog/how-to-track-macros-for-free-2026) with no premium tier, you're not paying a subscription just to know if you ate enough protein after your session.

## The Bottom Line

Workout nutrition doesn't need to be complicated. Here's the entire strategy in four lines:

1. Eat a meal with protein and carbs 1 to 3 hours before training
2. Eat a meal with protein (and ideally carbs) within a few hours after training
3. Don't panic about exact timing; total daily intake matters far more
4. Hit your [protein target](/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-per-day) across the whole day, not just around your workout

The best workout nutrition plan is one you can maintain consistently. Track your meals, hit your macros, train hard, and let the results come. No special supplements, no 30-minute panic, no unnecessary complexity.

Use our [free macro calculator](/calculator) to dial in your targets, then track your progress with [Chowdown](https://app.chowdown.me).
