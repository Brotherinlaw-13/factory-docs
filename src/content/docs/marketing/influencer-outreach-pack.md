I've been following your [content type] and love how real you keep it. I'm also on the macro tracking journey and got so fed up with MyFitnessPal that I actually built my own app called Chowdown (chowdown.me).

It's totally free and uses AI — you just snap a photo of your food and it logs all your macros automatically. No more searching databases or manual entry!

## 🤝 Collaboration Ideas

### 1. **Macro Breakdown Challenge**

**Why it works:**

- Shows Chowdown's accuracy in real-time
- Educational for audience
- Low effort for creator

**Call to action:** "Let's see how close my macro guess was vs AI! *scans with Chowdown*"

### 2. **Free vs Paid Tracker Honest Comparison**
**Concept:** Side-by-side testing of Chowdown vs MyFitnessPal/Cronometer for a full day of eating.

**Why it works:**

- Highlights convenience benefits

**Key points to cover:**
- Speed of logging
- Accuracy comparison  
- Cost difference ($0 vs $80/year)

- Creates narrative arc

**Content arc:**

**Scenarios to test:**

**Process:**
1. Initial recipe attempt + scan
2. Adjust ingredients based on macro targets
3. Final version with optimized macros

Hey Paige! 👋 

Your content on making macro tracking empowering (not restrictive) really hits different — especially your post about finding food freedom through understanding macros. 

I actually built a free AI macro tracker called Chowdown (chowdown.me) specifically for people who want the benefits of tracking without the tedious manual entry. You just snap a photo and it handles everything.

Thought it might be a useful tool to recommend to your coaching clients, especially the ones just starting their macro journey. Completely free, no premium paywall nonsense.

**Personalized Message:**
```
Hey Maxie!

Fellow macro nerd here 😄 Love your approach to helping people find "peace with food & power through nutrition" — that balance is everything.

I built a free AI macro tracker called Chowdown (chowdown.me) because I was frustrated with how expensive and clunky other tracking tools were. You photograph your food and it logs the macros automatically.

As a certified macro coach, I'd genuinely value your professional opinion on it. Does it feel accurate? Is the UX intuitive? Would you recommend it to clients?

Totally free, no catch. Just want feedback from someone who really knows this space.

Thanks!

**Research Notes:** Uses MyFitnessPal daily, handle is literally about calorie counting
**Personalized Message:**
```
Hey Claire! 👋

Fellow calorie tracker here! I saw you use MFP daily and I totally get the love-hate relationship with it.

I actually got so frustrated with the manual entry grind (and that $80/year premium cost 😅) that I built a free alternative called Chowdown (chowdown.me).

You literally just snap a photo of your food and it logs your calories + macros with AI. No searching databases, no premium features locked away.

Thought you might want to try it alongside your current tracking — would love to hear what someone who tracks as consistently as you thinks of it!

Keep crushing those goals 💪

### TikTok Targets

**Personalized Message:**
```
Hey Claire! 

Your macro breakdown videos are SO satisfying — I love how you always include the exact numbers (like that 410 cal, 50g protein bowl 🤤).

I built a free AI macro tracker called Chowdown (chowdown.me) that would probably make creating this content even easier. You just snap a photo and it gives you all the macro breakdowns automatically.

Your audience is clearly tracking macros actively, so they'd probably love having an easier way to log their meals. Totally free, no paywall!

Would love to see what you think of it 🙏

Diego
```

#### LARK (@knaakwell) - ~5-20K followers
**Research Notes:** Said "calorie tracking is the best thing I ever did," genuine tracking advocate
**Personalized Message:**
```
Hey LARK! 

I saw your video about calorie tracking being the best thing you ever did and I was like YES, someone gets it! 🙌

That's exactly why I built Chowdown (chowdown.me) — to make tracking even easier so more people could get those life-changing benefits you talked about.

It's completely free and uses AI to log macros from food photos. No manual entry, especially clutch for eating out (which I saw you mention as a tracking challenge).

Would love for you to try it and let me know what you think! 

Diego
```

### YouTube Targets

#### Janelle Rohner (@JanelleRohnerLifestyle) - 68.8K subscribers

**Personalized Message:**
```
Hey Janelle!

Love your "What I Eat in a Day as a Macro Coach" series — it's such valuable content for people learning to track macros properly.

I'm the founder of Chowdown (chowdown.me), a free AI macro tracker that logs food from photos. I think it could be a really cool tool to feature in one of your WIEIAD videos.

Imagine showing your audience how you can just snap photos throughout the day and get accurate macro tracking without any manual entry. Could be a great way to demonstrate how simple tracking can be when you have the right tools.

Totally free to use, and I'd love to collaborate on some content if you're interested!

Best,
Diego
